# Top-level Python requirements for development.
# Edit and add packages required by your ADK agents before running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

# Web / server
fastapi>=0.95.0
uvicorn[standard]>=0.22.0

# HTTP and env parsing
requests>=2.28.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0

# Optional: add ADK-related packages your environment needs (update as necessary)
# google-adk-package-name==x.y.z

# ADK CLI / dev server note:
# The ADK CLI/API server (used for `adk api_server`) is often distributed separately
# and may not be available as a pip package. Follow the ADK project's installation
# instructions instead of adding an unknown package here. Example installation docs:
# https://github.com/google/ai-controllers
# If you have a pip-installable ADK package for your environment, add it here, e.g.:
# adk-cli==X.Y.Z

# Alternative package manager: `uv` (Astral)
# If you'd prefer `uv` for environment/package management instead of pip/requirements.txt,
# install it with the project's installer and use it to provision the environment.
# Example (follow upstream docs for exact commands):
#   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# After installing `uv`, run the appropriate `uv` command to install packages (e.g. `uv install`)
# or follow your `uv` workflow. This repository keeps a `requirements.txt` for users who
# prefer pip-based installs.
